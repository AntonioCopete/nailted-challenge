Javascript developer challenge
The company has all the employee’s information in a .txt file and they want to create a small
SPA that consumes an API that makes the .txt easy to read.

In order to do that they want to implement the next actions:

-   It should be possible to list all the employees: It should have pagination, sort by name and
    surname and filter by email.
-   It should be possible to create a new employee.
-   It should be possible to see only one employee.
    All actions must be implemented in the backend. The backend will use the .txt file as a
    database.

    Requirements:

-   The server side should be done in node.js.
-   Typescript should be used.
-   Choose in both (backend and frontend) the frameworks you feel more comfortable.
    Considerations:
-   Try to have a good and clean architecture.
-   We will not focus on if the solution “just works”, we will focus on your approach, how
    do you slice the problems and solve the challenge.
    You can share a git repository with us, or share the project in the way you prefer.

The file attached follows the next format: id, name surname, address, phone, email,
birthdate.
